### Ticker Symbol Api End Point
####  What is the project about?
 Recently I had a hackathon challenge to work on realtime stock markect data end points.After the hours of research from the various stock market end-point-apis , I had short listed a few.I thought that might be enough to complete my project.

1) [IEX]('https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/') , 
Pros: 
A real boon to stock market app developers because of the free unlimited api calls without any limitation. 
Cons: 
No realtime data , only with 15 min delay

2) [AlphaVantage]('https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/'), 
Pros:
A site for pro developers with near realtime data/live stock data but comes with api key mess and limitation on requests/min made  

After a few days of walkthrough, I found my self on the fence because I have to make an auto complete search field like google search box for stock name/symbol searches.

the main catch here is [Symbol Search AutoComplete]('https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#symbolsearch') functionality already found in AlphaVantage, that too 5 API calls/min and 500 api calls/day.Imagine your end user typing keyword of length about 6 char in a minute then you will run out of APIs.

Then I had an idea of mixing the both worlds, no API key mess from IEX and high end functionality from AlphaVantage. At first I googled if any already existed but found none while yahoo fiance api was widely used for keyword search,sadly it's deprecated. I had no other choice to stick to AlphaVintage which costs around $30/month,30 api/min.

Thus I ended up making my own keyword filtering on ~8000 stock symbols  downloaded data.I thought it could be great if I host in cloud so that other devs can also use it.

#### In order to get the required search result , please provide `KEYWORD_SEARCH` in the following url

 `https://ticker-2e1ica8b9.now.sh//keyword/[KEYWORD_SEARCH]`
 eg : `https://ticker-2e1ica8b9.now.sh/keyword/googl`
 
#### output 

```
{
"results":
   [
    {"symbol":"GOOG","name":"Alphabet Inc."},
    {"symbol":"GOOGL","name":"Alphabet Inc."}
    ],
 "message":""
}

```

## **Ability to limit**
you can make request like this format below `<Base_url>/keyword/[KEYWORD_SEARCH]/limit/[NUMBER]`

eg : `https://ticker-2e1ica8b9.now.sh/keyword/goog/limit/1`

#### output
```
{"results":[{"symbol":"GOOG","name":"Alphabet Inc."}],"message":""}
```

## **Ability to add new tickers to the filesystem**

you can make request like this format below 
`<Base_url>/add/[symbol]/[name]`

eg : `https://ticker-2e1ica8b9.now.sh/add/META/thenewfacebookInc`

## **Ability to delete a ticker from the filesystem**

you can make request like this format below 
`<Base_url>/delete/[symbol]`

eg : `https://ticker-2e1ica8b9.now.sh/delete/META`

> **NOTE** : Both Ticker add and delete needs a server re-start unless you are using any nodemon or similar. 

## **To run the Project**
```
npm i && npm start
```


Pros
- Free Free Free
- No API key mess , No email spamming
- Nothing more Nothing less

Cons
- Weired API end point url 

## Technology Stack
1) NodeJS
2) Hosted on ZEIT ,with 100GB bandwidth and 3 instances available

## Roadmap
- documentation support for react,and javascript
- When user makes a query they will get the live stock price in return with matched reults
